# Database from the book SQL for Data Scientists by Ren√©e M. P. Teate
This is the original database that comes with the book and can be found on Wiley's site at the following [link](https://media.wiley.com/product_ancillary/67/11196693/DOWNLOAD/SQL%20for%20Data%20Scientists%20support%20files.zip).  
It was originally designed for MySQL.  
I've adapted it to support PostgreSQL.
